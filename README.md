# MissionX
AI enabled Slack chatbot for technical assistance

## PROBLEM	
1. To develop a Question Answering chatbot (using Artificial intelligence) that can answer technical questions 
2. Provide assistance for Nutanix’s Licensing application
3. Reside in a Slack channel of the company

## APPROACH
1. Document scraping
2. Dataset creation 
3. Pre-processing
4. Creation of training data
5. Modelling
6. Response prediction 
7. Integration with Slack
8. Bot as a service running on cloud

## CONCLUSIONS 
### Main Points:
1. Chatbot can be used over multiple applications (Used on Slack for now)
2. Chatbot listens to customer queries in passive mode, answers customer queries that can be answered with high confidence/accuracy (Responds to the query if the prediction probability surpasses a threshold value)
3. Customers can also explicitly wake the chatbot using the word "@missionx"
4. Answers customers queries for Nutanix’s licensing application (public documentation)
5. Provides link of the relevant and related articles along with some portion of article content
6. Uses thread to organize discussions
